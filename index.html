			  <p>Welcome to <span id="CompName">Partial Pressure Productions</span>, a team of siblings that produce, shoot and edit underwater, land and aerial video and provide full post-production services.</p>
			  <p>We can accommodate any video production you have in mind and specialize in helping small businesses, corporations, and non-profits visualize their mission.</p>
			  <p>We have been certified under the most rigorous standards in the diving industry. This provides us the buoyancy, trim, team diving concept and skills necessary to capture steady, in focus, footage of the desired subject in the most demanding environments. Our technical diving certifications allow us to reach deeper and stay longer at depths unachievable by under standard recreational diving limits.</p>
			  <p>We have been operators in aerial cinematography since 2011 and worked on independent films, documentaries, resort promotions and many other exciting projects.</p>
			  <p>We also dedicate a majority of our diving time to non-profit initiatives in our local waters to perserve our diving resources. We are proud to take responsibility in preserving our waters for future generations. If you have an organization that is in need of media representation, please let us know how we can assist your vision.</p>
			  <p>Join us as we document our journey through education, experience and exploration. </p>
			  <p>We have an online gallery of sample footage at <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/partialpressure">www.vimeo.com/partialpressure.</a></p>
